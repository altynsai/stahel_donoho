# Huberized Stahel-Donoho estimator
Most statistical models assume that there is some underlying distribution of
the data and often give misleading results when some observations show anomalous
behavior. Before starting using these models, statisticians need to deal with the
outliers causing bias in the estimates. Stahel-Donoho estimator is one of the
developed tools with great robustness properties aimed to detect outlying
observations. S. Van Aelst, E. Vandervieren, and G. Willemsa in their article ‘A
Stahel–Donoho estimator based on huberized outlyingness’ (2012) researched the
possibilities and limitations of the SD estimator and suggested huberization of the
data to overcome drawbacks of the original estimator.
